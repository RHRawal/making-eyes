title: BlueEyes' Concurrency Model
---

The main construct for concurrency in BlueEyes is the `Future`. A Future represents a computation that will finish at some point in ... the future. The concepts of futures is reasonably common; Java provides an implementation in `java.util.concurrent`, as does Akka. BlueEyes' Future is similar to these. It is used pervasively in BlueEyes, so we must become familiar with it to write any sizable system.
